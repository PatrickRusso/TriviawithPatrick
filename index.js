//TRIVIA GAME OUTLINE
//music producer quiz

//In my trivia game, the user will load up their browser and be met with an alert asking them to type in their name.

//after a name is typed in the bar, the user will be directed to the main menu of the game, with their name being displayed somehow at the top

//if i can play an instrumental while the user is taking the quiz I will but I am not sure how that works.

//Here the user is met with a Test your knowledge button(Play), a change theme button(light mode or dark mode), 
//need more ideas above but these are the buttons I am sure about.

//after the user clicks dark mode (because you are insane if you don't, the screen will turn a cool black and purple gradient)
//Dark mode could either be space theme or futuristic theme

//If the user is insane and wants to go light mode it will be something like a 64bit pen and paper styled game with a non default white background and black text.(maybe the background will be a school desk with paper and a pencil, with the game being played on paper.)

//After the user chooses their respective theme, they will be directed to the quiz.

//the quiz will most likely be multiple choice but it could have and opionated short answer question for the last question so the user automatically gets that one correct.
//maybe the last question will be 'How did you feel about project1? with a congratulations screen after submitted.
